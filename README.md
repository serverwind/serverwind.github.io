# lestrangeqq.github.io
Portfolio with some of my works (in active development now). Small CSS/JS projects can be found here, in /proj directory.

...especially:

# FootNotes.JS
Lightweight (4kb) script on pure JS, what creates footnotes in your article, and also list with all of this notes.
Very easy to implent, and also easy to use. Working example here https://lestrangeqq.github.io/footNotes.html , click on [1], [2] etc. This is my first big script, and I'll be happy if someone find it useful.
